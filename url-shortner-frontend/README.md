# Front End Interface

## Prerequisites
1. axios package is used for api calls.
2. Bootswatch(a variation of Bootstrap 4) is used for styling framework.
3. Form validation is implemented in the front end.
4. Dynamic form builder(copied from the open source dynamic-ui-components library myself being the author) is used to create the form.

## To run the React front end server in development environment follow the steps
1. cd into url-shortner-frontend folder
2. Install all the dependencies running
```
$ npm install 
```
3. To run the server
```
$ npm start
```

## Improvements
1. Build a better error handling process when api calls are made for example a 404 error page can be created.
2. A new functional component can be created for the Table under the ui folder and called from the App.js file.
